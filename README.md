# tools_cascadegui
Tool cascade gui is a framework to create a sequential signal processing model.
Example: import data, preprocess, train model, test model
GUI tabs are generic componenets that can be easily adapted for tweaking
the backend operation. Each tab holds a output values of the tab left to
it as input and can display graphs that represent the current state of the data
The model can be refreshed at any point along its linear flow.
